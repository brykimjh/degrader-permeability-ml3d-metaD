Energy minimization in explicit solvent
 &cntrl
  imin   = 1,      ! Perform energy minimization
  maxcyc = 1000,   ! Maximum number of minimization cycles
  ncyc   = 500,    ! Number of steepest descent cycles
  ntb    = 1,      ! Constant volume periodic boundary conditions
  cut    = 8.0,    ! Non-bonded cutoff (in Angstroms)
  ntr    = 0,      ! No restraints
  ntpr   = 1,      ! Print energy info every ntpr steps
